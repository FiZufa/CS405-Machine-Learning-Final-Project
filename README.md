# Traffic-Sign Detection and Recognition
This project is the final group project of Machine Learning (CS405) SUSTech Fall 2023 taught by [Prof. Hao Qi](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/haoqi.html). I migrated the works and results from our previous local space to this repository for better documentation. Our team members are:
1. Anthony Bryan
2. Fitria Zusni Farida
3. Nguyen Thanh Lam
4. Ryan Tang Tze Hou

## Background
Traffic-sign detection and recognition refer to the technology and processes used to identify and interpret various road signs and signals in the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles. This vital field plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety, improving traffic management, and enabling the successful deployment of autonomous vehicles. This project aims to delve into the intricacies of Traffic-Sign Detection and Recognition, ultimately developing and deploying a custom deep neural network to address real-world scenarios.

## Objectives
- Based on the research, we will meticulously evaluate the various models and select the most suitable one to implement for this project. The chosen model should exhibit the potential for real-world applicability and robust performance
- Building upon the selected model, we will actively seek opportunities to enhance its performance. This may involve fine-tuning parameters, implementing innovative algorithms, or exploring novel techniques to optimize Traffic-Sign Detection and Recognition.
